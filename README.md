# Retinal-Optical-Coherance-Tomography
Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross sections of the retinas of living patients. Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time (Swanson and Fujimoto, 2017).

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (NORMAL,CNV,DME,DRUSEN). There are 84,495 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 4 categories (NORMAL,CNV,DME,DRUSEN).

Images are labeled as (disease)-(randomized patient ID)-(image number by this patient) and split into 4 directories: CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL.
